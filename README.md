# 🔑 The Broken Keygen Branches — A Git Forensics Puzzle 

> “Not all that compiles is true — sometimes the lie runs perfectly.”

A once-stable system now lies fractured, its license key scattered across branches and buried under layers of “fixes.”  
Your mission: **recover what was lost** by navigating history itself.

---

## 🧩 Objective

Recover the **hidden license key** by gathering the correct fragments from different feature branches — and assemble them in their proper chronological order.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Riddles & Hints  
> Treat these as riddles, not instructions — they point your eyes, not your fingers.

### 🧩 Riddle 1 — *The Exact Moment of Undo*  
I wasn’t shattered by a crash, but by a **quiet rewrite**.  
The fix you seek is **not always just one step back** — stray documentation or configuration tweaks may lurk between.  
You must **trace the file’s history** with precision and uncover the exact moment its integrity was last real.  


---

### ⏳ Riddle 2 — *The Timekeeper*  
I live not by branches, but by **timestamps**.  
Each fragment first drew breath at a different moment — those birthdates whisper the order.  
The eldest voice speaks first; the youngest completes the song.  


---

### 🧠 Riddle 3 — *The Plausible Lie*  
I seem honest — I run, I output a string, maybe even Base64.  
Yet something inside is **off by a salt, a shift, or an encoding**.  
My deceit is elegant, but my ancestor spoke the truth.

## 🧵 Flavor Text

Once, this repository was a tidy workshop — each branch a clean feature.  
Then came the refactor storm. Now, the true fragments are buried under commits of confusion.  
You, brave archaeologist, must **dig through the Git layers**, brush away the noise, and reforge the broken license.
